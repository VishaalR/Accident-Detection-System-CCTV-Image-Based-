# Accident-Detection-System-CCTV-Image-Based
YOLO-based accident detection from CCTV footage and images using Python, OpenCV, and Deep Learning.
# Week 1 Project Initialization
This week marks the initiation of the Accident Detection from CCTV Footage or Images project. The main objective of this system is to automatically detect accidents from CCTV video frames or still images using AI-based object detection models and send instant alerts to nearby officials or emergency responders to enable faster assistance and improve road safety.
## 🧰 Tools Used  
- **Python** – Core programming language for model training and integration  
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** – Object detection model for accident identification  
- **Roboflow** – Dataset management
