# Accident-Detection-System-CCTV-Image-Based
YOLO-based accident detection from CCTV footage and images using Python.
This project is being developed as part of an internship at Edunet Foundation, in collaboration with AICTE and Shell.
# Week 1 Project Initialization
This week marks the initiation of the Accident Detection from CCTV Footage or Images project. The main objective of this system is to automatically detect accidents from CCTV video frames or still images using AI-based object detection models and send instant alerts to nearby officials or emergency responders to enable faster assistance and improve road safety.
# Week 2 – Accident Detection Module
Added the accident detection script that uses the trained model to process images or videos, highlight accident regions with bounding boxes, and save the output video for further analysis.
##  Tools Used (as of 08/11/2025)  
- **Python** – Core programming language for model training and integration  
- **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** – Object detection model for accident identification  
- **Roboflow** – Dataset management
- **OpenCV**  – Used for video processing, drawing detections, and saving output videos
